# Sheer Heart Attack
By: Jordan Crawford-O'Banner

### Dataset
I plan to use the data collected by the Cleveland Heart Disease Database. I have the data in hand, and the data is not missing any values. It is currently not in a format that is readable by python, so I will need to  put the data in a format that is easily accessible. The dataset contains a lot of personal medical information, and I should not use it to track people down or reveal the information in a format that targets anyone specifically. I should also not misrepresent the data to show that any particular attribute causes heart disease more than others without the proof to back it up

### Questions
Using this dataset, I can explore the different pieces of a persons medical history that may contribute to them developing heart disease. I could then categorize, which of these variable have the largest effect and use them to predict whether or not a person will develop heart disease.

### Computational Tools
I am considering using the deep learning algorithms we learned about through datacamp in order to achieve this.
