### The Virtue of the God-fearing Man
By: Jordan Crawford-O'Banner

I am planning to work with the data from the General Social Survey. I already have access to the data, but I do not yet have all of the data I would like downloaded or filtered. I cannot find specific restrictions on using the GSS data that I would like to use, although there are specific ways to access more sensitive data In terms of ethical concerns, I should not construe the data in such a way that I misrepresent a subgroup of people or make claims that cannot be supported with the data I have obtained.

The question I am looking to explore is the differing behaviors between people in the United States who identify themselves being very religious versus people who identify themselves as being not religious at all. I am more specifically looking to compare the moral opinions of these two groups and how they align with some predefined set of moral values that has been agreed upon.
